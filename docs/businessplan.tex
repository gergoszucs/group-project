\section*{Executive Summary}

The task at hand is to improve a given program suit consisting of the programs SurfIT, MoveIt and FlexIT.
There are many ways of making the software better: Enhance code readability, fix minor bugs, improve the user interface but most importantly increase the performance. To gain performance we try to optimize the CUDA implementation but we also want to try the software on different systems to see how it influences the runtime. One of the systems we want to try is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. They provide instances with dedicated GPUs on which we want to run FlexIT on. 


\section{Background and Purpose}
Designing and building an airplane is a highly expensive and time consuming process. First a model has to be built and put in a wind tunnel where its aerodynamics can be measured. This is a error prone and lengthly process. It is a lot cheaper to create a digital model and simulate the aerodynamics on a computer.

One such software to simulate aerodynamics is developed at Cranfield University by Dr Dominique Fleischmann. In the course of the Group Project several student teams will try their best to improve this software.




\section{Group Structure and Management}

Group 1 consists of 5 team members. Each of them has a specific role. There is one person working general code structure and readability, two people focus on the CUDA implementation, the mathematician of the group is working on the algorithm to see if it can be made more efficient and one member is working on software deployment on different systems. We all try to fix bugs in the process of working with the software. A bug tracking system was implemented.

All of us are committed to work together. If one team member encounters a problem he cannot solve then we will shift resources to tackle this problem together.
