Cranfield group project

To run the project open Visual Studio and install the 3 Qt extensions.

After that restart VS, click the Qt5 menu then Qt Options and add your current Qt version. It should look something like this: C:\Qt\Qt5.6.2\5.6\msvc2015. If you have the 64-bit version (the name should be msvc2015-x64 or something) then it probably won't work, you need to download the 32-bit Qt (http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015-5.6.2.exe).

But still, let's go have a nap in 220.
